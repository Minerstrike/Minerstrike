My first experience with coding was in highschool, we were asked to write simple windows applications. I've always had a nack for numbers, patterns and logic. Discovering coding for the first time was like finding out I could play a puzzle game for the rest of my life. Ever since it's been the only thing I could ever see myself doing.
