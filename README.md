I my first experience with coding was in highschool, we were asked to write simple windows applications. I've always had a nack for numbers, patterns and logic. Discoving coding for the first time was like finding out I could play a puzzle game for the rest of my life. Ever since it's been the only thing I could ever see myself doing.

I'm currently on the look out for a <i>fullstack</i> or <em>Backend</em> position. I'd especiqally like to work for a company with a positive and thoughtful culture. 

If you're hiring, let's chat!
